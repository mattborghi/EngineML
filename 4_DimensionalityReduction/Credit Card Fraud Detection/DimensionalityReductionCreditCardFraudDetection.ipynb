I've noticed a recent increase of interest towards this kernel so I will focus more on the steps I took and why I took them to make it clear why I took those steps.\n\n<h2>Before we Begin:  </h2>\nIf you liked my work, please upvote this kernel since it will keep me motivated to perform more in-depth reserach towards this subject and will look for more efficient ways so that our models are able to detect more accurately both fraud and non-fraud transactions.\n\n<h2> Introduction </h2>\nIn this kernel we will use various predictive models to see how accurate they  are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud. As described in the dataset, the features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons. Nevertheless, we can still analyze some important aspects of the dataset. Let's start!\n\n\n<h2> Our Goals: </h2>\n<ul>\n<li> Understand the little distribution of the \"little\" data that was provided to us. </li>\n<li> Create a 50/50 sub-dataframe ratio of \"Fraud\" and \"Non-Fraud\" transactions. (NearMiss Algorithm) </li>\n<li> Determine the Classifiers we are going to use and decide which one has a higher accuracy. </li>\n<li>Create a Neural Network and compare the accuracy to our best classifier. </li>\n<li>Understand common mistaked made with imbalanced datasets. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2> Outline: </h2>\nI. <b>Understanding our data</b><br>\na) [Gather Sense of our data](#gather)<br><br>\n\nII. <b>Preprocessing</b><br>\na) [Scaling and Distributing](#distributing)<br>\nb) [Splitting the Data](#splitting)<br><br>\n\nIII. <b>Random UnderSampling and Oversampling</b><br>\na) [Distributing and Correlating](#correlating)<br>\nb) [Anomaly Detection](#anomaly)<br>\nc) [Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering (t-SNE)](#clustering)<br>\nd) [Classifiers](#classifiers)<br>\ne) [A Deeper Look into Logistic Regression](#logistic)<br>\nf) [Oversampling with SMOTE](#smote)<br><br>\n\nIV. <b>Testing </b><br>\na) [Testing with Logistic Regression](#testing_logistic)<br>\nb) [Neural Networks Testing (Undersampling vs Oversampling)](#neural_networks)\n\n<h2>Correcting Previous Mistakes from Imbalanced Datasets: </h2>\n<ul>\n<li> Never test on the oversampled or undersampled dataset.</li>\n<li>If we want to implement cross validation, remember to oversample or undersample your training data <b>during</b> cross-validation, not before! </li>\n<li> Don't use <b>accuracy score </b> as a metric with imbalanced datasets (will be usually high and misleading), instead use <b>f1-score, precision/recall score or confusion matrix </b></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2> References: </h2>\n<ul> \n<li>Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron (O'Reilly).

However, it is important that we use the correct dataframe (subsample)  in order for us to see which features have a high positive or negative correlation with regards to fraud transactions.\n\n### Summary and Explanation: \n<ul>\n<li><b>Negative Correlations: </b>V17, V14, V12 and V10 are negatively correlated. Notice how the lower these values are, the more likely the end result will be a fraud transaction.  </li>\n<li> <b> Positive Correlations: </b> V2, V4, V11, and V19 are positively correlated. Notice how the higher these values are, the more likely the end result will be a fraud transaction. </li>\n<li> <b>BoxPlots: </b>  We will use boxplots to have a better understanding of the distribution of these features in fradulent and non fradulent transactions. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n**Note: ** We have to make sure we use the subsample in our correlation matrix or else our correlation matrix will be affected by the high imbalance between our classes. This occurs due to the high class imbalance in the original dataframe."

This will have a positive impact on the accuracy of our models.  <br><br>\n\n\n### Interquartile Range Method:\n<ul>\n<li> <b>Interquartile Range (IQR): </b> We calculate this by the difference between the 75th percentile and 25th percentile. Our aim is to create a threshold beyond the 75th and 25th percentile that in case some instance pass this threshold the instance will be deleted.  </li>\n<li> <b>Boxplots: </b> Besides easily seeing the 25th and 75th percentiles (both end of the squares) it is also easy to see extreme outliers (points beyond the lower and higher extreme). </li>\n</ul>\n\n### Outlier Removal Tradeoff:\nWe have to be careful as to how far do we want the threshold for removing outliers. We determine the threshold by multiplying a number (ex: 1.5) by the (Interquartile Range). The higher this threshold is, the less outliers will detect (multiplying by a higher number ex: 3), and the lower this threshold is the more outliers it will detect.  <br><br>\n\n**The Tradeoff: **\nThe lower the threshold the more outliers it will remove however, we want to focus more on \"extreme outliers\" rather than just outliers. Why? because we might run the risk of information loss which will cause our models to have a lower accuracy. You can play with this threshold and see how it affects the accuracy of our classification models.\n\n\n### Summary:\n<ul>\n<li> <b> Visualize Distributions: </b> We first start by visualizing the distribution of the feature we are going to use to eliminate some of the outliers. V14 is the only feature that has a Gaussian distribution compared to features V12 and V10. </li>\n<li><b>Determining the threshold: </b> After we decide which number we will use to multiply with the iqr (the lower more outliers removed), we will proceed in determining the upper and lower thresholds by substrating q25 - threshold (lower extreme threshold) and adding q75 + threshold (upper extreme threshold). </li>\n<li> <b>Conditional Dropping: </b> Lastly, we create a conditional dropping stating that if the \"threshold\" is exceeded in both extremes, the instances will be removed. </li>\n<li> <b> Boxplot Representation: </b> Visualize through the boxplot that the number of \"extreme outliers\" have been reduced to a considerable amount. </li>\n</ul>\n\n**Note:** After implementing outlier reduction our accuracy has been improved by over 3%! Some outliers can distort the accuracy of our models but remember, we have to avoid an extreme amount of information loss or else our model runs the risk of underfitting.\n\n\n**Reference**: More information on Interquartile Range Method: <a src=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-use-statistics-to-identify-outliers-in-data/\"> How to Use Statistics to Identify Outliers in Data </a> by Jason Brownless (Machine Learning Mastery blog)"

Unlike Random UnderSampling, SMOTE creates new synthetic points in order to have an equal balance of the classes. This is another alternative for solving the \"class imbalance problems\". <br><br>\n\n\n<b> Understanding SMOTE: </b>\n<ul>\n<li> <b> Solving the Class Imbalance: </b> SMOTE creates synthetic points from the minority class in order to reach an equal balance between the minority and majority class. </li>\n<li><b>Location of the synthetic points: </b>   SMOTE picks the distance between the closest neighbors of the minority class, in between these distances it creates synthetic points. </li>\n<li> <b>Final Effect:  </b> More information is retained since we didn't have to delete any rows unlike in random undersampling.</li>\n<li><b> Accuracy || Time Tradeoff: </b> Although it is likely that SMOTE will be more accurate than random under-sampling, it will take more time to train since no rows are eliminated as previously stated.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n### Cross Validation Overfitting Mistake:\n## Overfitting during Cross Validation:  \nIn our undersample analysis I want to show you a common mistake I made that I want to share with all of you. It is simple, if you want to undersample or oversample your data you should not do it before cross validating. Why because you will be directly influencing the validation set before implementing cross-validation causing a \"data leakage\" problem. <b>In the following section you will see amazing precision and recall scores but in reality our data is overfitting!</b>\n### The Wrong Way:\n<img src=\"https://www.marcoaltini.com/uploads/1/3/2/3/13234002/2639934.jpg?401\"><br>\n\nAs mentioned previously, if we get the minority class (\"Fraud) in our case, and create the synthetic points before cross validating we have a certain influence on the \"validation set\" of the cross validation process. Remember how cross validation works, let's assume we are splitting the data into 5 batches, 4/5 of the dataset will be the training set while 1/5 will be the validation set. The test set should not be touched! For that reason, we have to do the creation of synthetic datapoints \"during\" cross-validation and not before, just like below: <br>\n\n\n### The Right Way:\n<img src=\"https://www.marcoaltini.com/uploads/1/3/2/3/13234002/9101820.jpg?372\"> <br>\nAs you see above, SMOTE occurs \"during\" cross validation and not \"prior\" to the cross validation process. Synthetic data are created only for the training set without affecting the validation set.\n\n\n\n\n**References**: \n<ul>\n<li><a src=\"https://www.marcoaltini.com/blog/dealing-with-imbalanced-data-undersampling-oversampling-and-proper-cross-validation\"> \nDEALING WITH IMBALANCED DATA: UNDERSAMPLING, OVERSAMPLING AND PROPER CROSS-VALIDATION </a></li> \n\n<li> <a src=\"http://rikunert.com/SMOTE_explained \"> SMOTE explained for noobs  </a></li>\n<li> <a src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQC_YE3I5ig&t=794s\"> Machine Learning - Over-& Undersampling - Python/ Scikit/ Scikit-Imblearn </a></li>\n</ul>"

Why not only focus on fraud? Imagine you were a cardholder and after you purchased an item your card gets blocked because the bank's algorithm thought your purchase was a fraud. That's why we shouldn't emphasize only in detecting fraud cases but we should also emphasize correctly categorizing non-fraud transactions.\n\n\n### The Confusion Matrix:\nHere is again, how the confusion matrix works:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Upper Left Square: </b> The amount of <b>correctly</b> classified by our model of  no fraud transactions. </li>\n<li> <b>Upper Right Square:</b> The amount of  <b>incorrectly </b> classified transactions as fraud cases, but the actual label is <b> no fraud </b>. </li>\n<li><b>Lower Left Square:</b> The amount of <b> incorrectly </b> classified transactions as no fraud cases, but the actual label is <b>fraud </b>. </li>\n<li><b> Lower Right Square:</b> The amount of  <b>correctly</b> classified by our model of fraud transactions. </li>\n</ul>\n\n### Summary (Keras || Random UnderSampling):\n<ul>\n<li><b>Dataset: </b> In this final phase of testing we will fit this model in both the <b>random undersampled subset</b>  and <b> oversampled dataset (SMOTE) </b>in order to predict the final result using the <b>original dataframe testing data.</b> </li>\n<li>  <b>Neural Network Structure: </b> As stated previously, this will be a simple model composed of one input layer (where the number of nodes equals the number of features) plus bias node, one hidden layer with 32 nodes and one output node composed of two possible results 0 or 1 (No fraud or fraud). </li>\n<li> <b>Other characteristics:</b> The learning rate will be 0.001, the optimizer we will use is the AdamOptimizer, the activation function that is used in this scenario is \"Relu\" and for the final outputs we will use sparse categorical cross entropy, which gives the probability whether an instance case is no fraud or fraud (The prediction will pick the highest probability between the two.) </li>\n</ul>\n"

Nevertheless, I still have to state that sometimes the neural network on the oversampled dataset predicts less correct fraud transactions than our model using the undersample dataset. However, remember that the removal of outliers was implemented only on the random undersample dataset and not on the oversampled one. Also, in our undersample data our model is unable to detect for a large number of cases non fraud transactions correctly and instead, misclassifies those non fraud transactions as fraud cases. Imagine that people that were making regular purchases got their card blocked due to the reason that our model classified that transaction as a fraud transaction, this will be a huge disadvantage for the financial institution. The number of customer complaints and customer disatisfaction will increase.  The next step of this analysis will be to do an outlier removal on our oversample dataset and see if our accuracy in the test set improves. <br><br>\n\n**Note:** One last thing, predictions and accuracies may be subjected to change since I implemented data shuffling on both types of dataframes. The main thing is to see if our models are able to correctly classify no fraud and fraud transactions. I will bring more updates, stay tuned!\n"
